Facts you know: the app stores notes as rich text with embedded images; workspaces on the Business plan have up to 500 members; an admin said their legal team must keep a copy of all notes when an employee leaves.

Restate this request as (1) the user outcome in one sentence, naming who needs it, (2) two constraints that come from the facts above, (3) two assumptions you would need to confirm, and (4) one observable success condition. Keep "an export button" out of the outcome sentence itself.`,

Evidence: 40 tickets last month said meetings showed at the wrong time; 31 of those came from users who had traveled; the app reads the time zone once at sign-up and never updates it; no ticket mentions the banner idea.

Separate the underlying user problem from the proposed solution. Then list two assumptions behind the banner proposal and, for each, say what quick evidence would confirm or reject it. End with one alternative direction the evidence suggests.`,

The full wish list: monthly and weekly schedules, custom intervals, editing one occurrence vs. all future ones, push reminders, automatic bank matching, and a forecast chart. The core outcome: a user who pays rent monthly should not have to re-enter it each month and should see it in that month's total.

Define the smallest MVP slice that still delivers the core outcome. List what is in it, at least three explicit non-goals from the wish list, and one reason the slice still serves the outcome. Name one non-goal that would be hardest to add later if you design the slice carelessly.`,

Option B: resize images in the browser before upload to at most 2048 px. About 6 days of work; must handle HEIC photos from iPhones, which the current image library does not decode; once listings hold only resized images, the originals are gone.

Orders are confirmed by the server after payment; the browser may close before the confirmation page loads. A user can try several codes in one session.

Produce an event schema: event names, when each fires (browser or server, and at what moment), and the properties with identifiers needed to compute the metric exactly.

- onboarding_started fires each time the welcome screen renders, including after app restarts.
- onboarding_finished fires on the last screen, keyed by device_id; users who sign in on a second phone get a new device_id.
- step_skipped includes the property free_text_goal, the user's typed health goal.
- Users who uninstall mid-onboarding are excluded from the weekly report.

Identify the defect in each bullet, name its category (duplicated or missing events, ambiguous identity, a privacy problem, or survivorship bias), and say whether and how it affects the completion rate; if a defect does not bias the rate, say so and name the other risk it creates instead.

4. Testing.

Rewrite the plan as three or four vertical slices, each delivering a thin end-to-end behavior that can be demonstrated and verified on its own. For each slice, state how you would verify it is done. Explain one concrete problem the layer-by-layer plan would hide until late.`,

Facts: the team built a similar Excel import last year in about 8 working days; this CRM has a stricter duplicate-email rule that nobody has implemented before; one engineer is available full-time.

Give a bounded estimate as a range (or relative sizing against the Excel import), list the assumptions it depends on, and state which uncertainty most widens the range. Say what you would report if, after two days, the duplicate rule turns out to need a schema change.`,

    prompt: `A user clicks a link to https://recipes.example/pasta for the first time. Setup facts (already done; not part of the question): the DNS lookup and the HTTPS connection to recipes.example are complete, and the server returns this HTML in 300 ms:

</head>
<body>
  <h1>Pasta</h1>

app.js (120 KB) runs when the synchronous script loads and registers a DOMContentLoaded callback. That callback waits until the DOM is ready (DOMContentLoaded), then fetches /api/steps and inserts the returned steps into #steps; the callback never accesses #steps before it exists. Assume no caching and no service worker.

Answer two things:
1. Explain how /app.css and the synchronous /app.js in the head affect when the "Pasta" heading can first appear on screen, and name one change to this HTML that would let the heading appear sooner, with the reason.
2. Put these events in order and say briefly why: the /api/steps response arrives, app.js finishes downloading and runs, the steps appear in #steps.`,

Semantics: fetch resolves for any HTTP status, including 404 and 500, and rejects only on network failure or abort; aborting rejects with an error named "AbortError". The server returns 404 with body {"error":"not found"} for unknown users.

Trace what the user sees for (1) a 404, (2) a 500 whose body is an HTML error page, and (3) the request being aborted because the user navigated to another profile. Then describe how you would change the code so each case shows an appropriate state.`,

});

The browser runs one task at a time on the main thread and only paints between tasks. Users report that typed characters appear late and the spinner never shows.

Explain both symptoms using the task and rendering model. Then predict whether wrapping the filterAndSort and render calls in setTimeout(..., 0) makes the spinner appear and whether typing becomes responsive during the 900 ms. Propose one approach that actually keeps typing responsive.`,

For each line, choose the native platform element or API you would use instead (link, button, form behavior, history/navigation, or storage) and give one concrete behavior the user or browser gets from the native choice that the current code lacks.

<BottomHalf> item list, "Cancel order" confirmation dialog, delivery map

Behavior facts: cancelling is allowed only while status is "placed"; after a successful cancel the status badge and the item list both change; the delivery map polls a courier location API every 10 s and nothing else uses that data; the item list's sort choice affects only the list.

Propose a component breakdown whose boundaries follow behavior and data ownership. For each component, say what data or state it owns and what it receives as props. Explain where cancel state and the courier polling should live and why the TopHalf/BottomHalf split makes the cancel flow awkward.`,
    rubric: [

  function applyCoupon(code) { setCoupon(code); setDiscounted(applyCode(total, code)); }
  // renders count, total, discounted, and a coupon input
}

Semantics: useState keeps its value across renders and ignores later changes to its initial argument; effects run after the render is painted. sum(items) returns the total of item prices; applyCode(total, code) returns the discounted total; both are pure and neither mutates its inputs.

Identify which values are source-of-truth state and which are derived. Describe a bug a user could see when items change after a coupon was applied, and what the screen shows for one render after items change. Then describe in words (or show, if you prefer) how you would change the component's state so no derived value is stored; writing working code is not required.`,

New requirements: a "Clear filters" button in the page header must reset both controls, and the list must update as the user types (no Apply button).

Decide which component owns the filter state and describe in words (or sketch in code, optional) the controlled version: the owner's state, the props passed to Sidebar, and the event handlers. Explain how the header's Clear button updates both the controls and the list.`,

Semantics: chat.connect opens a socket that stays open until conn.close() is called. An effect's returned function runs before the effect re-runs and on unmount.

For each effect, decide whether it is really a value computed during render, logic that belongs to a user event, or synchronization with an outside system.

Semantics: React preserves a component's state while the same component type stays at the same position in the tree; changing its key creates a fresh instance. A null child still occupies its position.

Predict the input's value when an admin has typed "Ann B" for user Ann and then selects user Bo. Predict whether toggling isAdmin resets the form.

On timeout the client cannot tell whether the charge happened.

Specify the form's behavior from the moment Donate is pressed: while waiting, after success, after an error, and when the user tries again. Say what the button and fields show in each state, how you prevent a duplicate charge from double-clicks and from retrying after a timeout, and which user input you keep after an error.`,
